# Shodan Eye Ethical Hacking Tool Release
Before we start the year 2020, today there is a new big release ..! 
Please note, if you have already installed Shodan Eye on your computer, then it is worthwhile to read it carefully. Of course, even if you donâ€™t know this Shodan tool yet.

* Shodan Eye goes from python 2 to python 3
* Save the output of the Shodan Eye results
* The entry of the Shodan password is no longer visible.


# Shodan 
Is a search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet using a variety of filters. Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which are metadata that the server sends back to the client.


***What is the difference between Google or another search engine:***
The most fundamental difference is that Shodan Eye crawls on the internet, Google on the World Wide Web. However, the devices that support the World Wide Web are only a small part of what is actually connected to the Internet.
