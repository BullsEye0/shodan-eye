# Shodan Eye Ethical Hacking Tool Release
Before we start 2020, there is a new big release! 
Please note, if you have already installed Shodan Eye on your computer, then it is worthwhile to read the following carefully. 

* Shodan Eye has moved from python 2 to python 3
* You can now save the output of Shodan Eye results
* The entry of your Shodan password is no longer visible on your screen.


# Shodan 
Shodan is a search engine that lets a user find specific types of network integrated devices (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) using a variety of filters.


***What is the difference between Google and Shodan:***
The most fundamental difference is that Shodan crawls on the internet, Google queries the World Wide Web. However, the devices and services listed on Google are only a small portion of what is actually connected to the internet.

For additional data gathering, you can enter a Shodan API key when prompted.
A Shodan API key can be found here: https://account.shodan.io/register
