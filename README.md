# Shodan Eye
This tool collects all information about all devices that are directly connected to the internet with the specified keywords that you enter. This way you get a complete overview.

The types of devices that are indexed can vary enormously: from small desktops, refrigerators to nuclear power plants and everything in between. You can find everything using "your own" specified keywords. Examples can be found in a file that is attached:

The information obtained with this tool can be applied in many areas, a small example:
* Network security, keep an eye on all devices in your company or at home that are confronted with internet.
* Vulnerabilities.
And so much more.

***What is the difference between Google or another search engine:***
The most fundamental difference is that Shodan Eye crawls on the internet, Google on the World Wide Web. However, the devices that support the World Wide Web are only a small part of what is actually connected to the Internet.

## Python:

I made this script in python 2.7
