# Shodan Eye Ethical Hacking Tool Release
Before we start the year 2020, today there is a new big release ..! 
Please note, if you have already installed Shodan Eye on your computer, then it is worthwhile to read it carefully. Of course, even if you don’t know this Shodan tool yet.

* Shodan Eye goes from python 2 to python 3
* Save the output of the Shodan Eye results
* The entry of the Shodan password is no longer visible.


# Shodan 
Is a search engine that lets the user find specific types of computers (webcams, routers, servers, etc.) connected to the internet using a variety of filters. Some have also described it as a search engine of service banners, which are metadata that the server sends back to the client.


***What is the difference between Google or another search engine:***
The most fundamental difference is that Shodan Eye crawls on the internet, Google on the World Wide Web. However, the devices that support the World Wide Web are only a small part of what is actually connected to the Internet.
